# Doing Fine - Peace of Mind on Autopilot
Keep track of your elder loved ones with our convenient check-ins, newsfeed, and wellness dashboard.
## Project Overview
Doing Fine is a case study on using agile development and continuous market validation to solve the real world problem of keeping busy people informed of how their loved ones are doing. Development will be broken into two day sprints. Each sprint will test a critical assumption and value proposition - the result of each will be a user-tested, user-validated, and potentially shippable increment. Our goal is to progress as quickly as possible towards a low-fidelity, minimum viable product that users desperately want.
## Problem Arena
Due to the fact that we lead busy, fast-paced lives it is often difficult to keep up on how our loved ones are doing in a timely way. We anticipate there is a technological solution that can efficiently address this problem, providing significant value and peace of mind to its users.

## Iterative Cycle
1. Define Use Cases
1. Build a Product
1. Test accuracy of use case
1. Test whether the product solves for the use case well
